UW Git Hub Assignment 2

I have 2 kids, an 8 month son and 4 year old daughter who take up a lot of my time, and bring so much joy into my life.  My husband and I are very fortunate to have such wonderful kids and outside of work we strive to spend as much quality time together.  Family is a blessing in disguise.
